### Prompts and Answers

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

The most interesting topic that i have covered in my domain this quarter is probably test time adaptation. I had no prior knowledge of it coming in and now it is probably the most interesting thing I have learned at UCSD. Continual Test time adaptation effectively adapts off the shelf pre trained models to continually changing target data.


**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

A potential investigation would be how different similarities and loss functions work within continual test time adaptaion. Trying new loss functions, conjugate psuedo labels, cosign similariy are different ideas that could be fun to pursue in quarter 2.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

I think scheudleing would be a potential change. the scheudling feels a little disorganized between the class and all the other thigns surrounding the class. There is a lot to keep up with including assignments like participation and methodology and the rest of the class. So more structure would have been a better approach for the current quarter 1 project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

Some other techniques would be the applicaton of the CoTTA within real world applictions like self driving cars and or medical imaging. As for techniques, finding unique ways to minimize loss or finding a better loss function that effictively adapts data without error would be cool.
